# SCP FAQ 

**1.	Who should use the SCP platform for reporting?**

All SCP members and their suppliers (members/non-members) are expected to use the platform for reporting, starting from July 2025 onwards. SCP members will be invited to the platform via a system-generated email. Members can then add their suppliers and assign them a form for data collection via the platform. Their upstream suppliers will likewise be invited to the platform via a system-generated email and can sign up directly.

**2.	What if my suppliers are not SCP members? Do they have to join as a SCP member to submit the form?**

Your upstream suppliers do not need to register as an SCP member to submit the assigned forms to your company. They can simply sign up and login to the platform to access the assigned form/s and submit it to your company, once they have been invited through the SCP member's upstream list. 


**3.	How do I track my suppliers' responses when they have submitted the form to me?**

User organisations that have added their upstream supplier list will have their own dashboard to track their suppliers' (both member and non-member) submissions. Suppliers' submissions will be consolidated in the dashboard and they can download a single CSV file containing their suppliers' responses. 


**4.	After submitting the form, can I make amendments to the form?**

Users are unable to make amendments to the form after clicking the submit button. However, if necessary, please reach out to SCP Secretariat or your Dowsnstream Customer to reopen your submission.

**5.	Are all the questions and the uploading of files compulsory? Can I proceed without answering questions and uploading the file?**

All questions are not compulsory, so users can proceed with missing fields/without upload files. However, we recommend users to not leave blanks if possible. If there is no answer or not applicable, user can input NA into the field.

**6.	Can multiple users work on/edit the same form?**

Yes. The super admin user can invite teammates to work on the form. However, we advise against working on the form at the same time, as multiple users saving multiple data entries at the same time may result in data overwrite.

**7.	How do I save my answers?**

Users have to click the “Save” button (found at the bottom of every page) to save the answers, otherwise the answers will be lost when user logs out of the platform. Please ensure that the 'Saved successfully' notification appears before proceeding to logout/continue another action, else data loss might occur. 

**8.	What are the role differences in the User Management Setting?**

**Can edit and submit**: Users can only access features and buttons related to the form and can submit the form.
