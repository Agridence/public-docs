# Overview

Agridence offers users an end-to-end mapping and traceability service so that they are prepared to meet the EUDR requirements.

First, our Agridence field team will work with farmers on the ground for farm mapping, where they will provide training on the AgriTrace app. Subsequently, these data will be synchronised to the Polygon Mapping Risk Dashboard for deforestation and land legality analysis. Processors can then tag the traceability data to their shipment via the Agridence Rubber Platform (ARP) and generate a Due Diligence Report for their customer's and their own reference. 

By using our tools, users will have the confidence to make informed decisions that align with regulatory requirements. 

**1. Mapping and Traceability App (AgriTrace app)**
    - User-friendly mobile application for mapping plantation polygons in online and offline mode
    - Survey to ensure supply chain production is free of legal, social, and environmental concerns, and FPIC and land legality proof can be documented
    - Maintain product traceability through linkage of transaction between farmers, dealers, and factory (transactional traceability).
    - (Optional) Implement incentives and rewards program provided to farmers and dealers for their data 
    - Connect downstream to upstream actors in the supply chain, to tailor and cascade Capacity Building (CB) activities, like Good Agriculture Practice trainings (GAP), Agroforestry, replanting training, etc. 

**2. Field-mapping services**
    - Deployment of Agridence field team to map and verify the plantation polygons at the source
    - Localization and socialization with farmers to educate them on the EUDR requirements
    - Conduct EUDR risk assessment surveys with farmers
    - Obtain FPIC and land legality documentation proof (if available)
 
**3. Polygon Mapping Dashboard**
    - Repository of plantations mapped (From file uploads or traceability tool integration - AgriTrace app and/or external tools)
    - Map view of plantations with risk assessment layers for analysis
    - Calculate percentage and area of overlaps between risk layers and plantation polygons
 
**4. Traceability Dashboard** 
    - View polygon data associated to the selected Shipping Instruction (SI)
    - Map view with risk assessment layers for plantation analysis per SI
    - Calculate percentage and area of overlaps between risk layers and plantation polygons
    - Generate Due Diligence Report to provide users with proper documentation for EU DR compliance and uploading of data into the EU Information System (EU IS).
